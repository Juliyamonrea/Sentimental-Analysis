Electric scooters are yet to prove themselves and Aether is doing a great job at it while Ola and other chillar brands are ruining it. Also, it is not easy to miss those whatsapp forwards where electric scooters are burning. It is this uncertainty and fear that people will not have with a scooter like Activa (or any other ICE scooter for that matter). No father or mother would buy an electric scooter for their children even if they spot 1 whatsapp forward about the scooter burning. \n\nFor safety\'s sake, it is easier to choose the ""safer"" option which is Activa. After all, the extra 50k price difference can help buy around 490 litres of Petrol which is around 22-23k kms on the odo at 45kmpl. This is a lot for a regular commuter and makes it a much better deal. Activas are long lasting and there are people who still ride 10 year old activas without any issues. In fact, Activa has excellent resale value and even the exchange process at the Honda showroom is good. There is a lot of tech integration into ICE scooters and Honda has done pretty good stuff like including a silent starter and designing a new fuel efficient tyre compound. Even Yamaha has added a semi-hybrid on its 125cc engines on Fascino and RayZR.\n\nSo I don\'t personally see a reason why one would invest such money in a product unless one has money lying around or wants to satisfy their vanity feelings like they\'re ""saving the environment"" lol.'], ['@Takenyao123 they already have aerox , why would they launch another 150cc scoot'], ['@Nikhil D Rao y?'], [""It won't""], ['Do a video on when will nmax 155 come to india'], [""I'm just glad that i said 'Mummy Papa I want an Access 125'.
